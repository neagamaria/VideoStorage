# VideoStorage
This is a NodeJS project that creates a REST API.

## Initial setup
 I firstly created the package.json file with the **npm init** command. After that, I installed the express package (**npm install express --save**) and added the server.js file that establishes the connection to the server using this package.
The database used is a MYSQL localhost DB, so, before establsihing the connection, I installed the package for MySQL: **npm install mysql**. The connection to the database is created in the db_connection.js file.
